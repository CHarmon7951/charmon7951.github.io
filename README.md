# About Me.
## My Interests
After high school, I enlisted in the US Navy as an IT, unfortunately being put in the radio side instead of network. Now I'm a student Wake Tech studying cybersecurity. I enjoy playing video games, RPGs and Rhythm games in particular, and keeping up with my health with weight lifting and running.
## Websites I Recommend
  - [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) - a digital store from Valve corporation to purchase and manage games which has been around since 2003 and is the de facto PC gaming platform.
  - The [Mises Institute](https://mises.org/) - has some really interesting reads on politics and economics. The positions presented are rather fringe but offer unique perspectives.
